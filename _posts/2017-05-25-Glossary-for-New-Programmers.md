title: Glossary for New Programmers
---

If you are new to programming I am sure that you have found your self reading through a seemingly endless mass of documentation.  You have probably also found this mass of documentation peppered with jargon.  So, here is a short glossary of terms that should come in handy as you fall through the abyss of documentation.

## General Terms

####  Abstraction

Hiding complexity.  

Example:  Sending a text message is actually incredibly complicated but 99% of the complexity is hidden (abstracted) from the user as the user only has to press send.

What makes computers so powerful is their ability to absract complexity

####  Algorithm

A set of rules or steps to be followed in a problem solving operations.

Example: A recipe for cake.  The problem is how to get cake.  The solution is the recipe algorithm which is a step by step process that if followed returns cake.


### Boolean

A data type with only two possible values: true or false.

####  Business Logic

See this [post](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/234251/what-really-is-the-business-logic)

####  Compile

Convert into machine-code (lower level of code) so that the program can be run.

####  CRUD

An acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete.  It is used to refer to a type of app in which the user interacts with a database by Creating, Reading, Updating or Deleting something.

####  Database

A set of structured data that is accessible in a variety of ways   

####  Function

A section of a program that performs a specific task.  It may return a value or simply perform an operation.

####  High-level

In the context of programming languages a high-level language is closer to human language and further from machine language.

In a broader sense a high-level view of something obscures details to allow one to focus on the big picture.

####  Input

Data that goes into a function.

####  Low-level

In the contect of programming languages a low-level language is closer to machine language and further from human language.

In a broader sense a low-level view is focused on a few specific details.

####  Object

Holds data and functions/methods.  

Can be interacted with or changed by using well specified mechanisms.  

An instance of a class.   

#### Output

Data that gets returned by a function

####  Scope

Think of a function as existing with in a boundary.  The function has access to any variables that exist with in that boundary.  Anything outside of the boundary the function will not have access to.  This is scope.

####  Seperation of Concerns

A design prinicple for seperating a program into distinct sections that each address a certain concern or solve a specific problem.

#### Variable

A storage location identified by a name.  The data stored inside is referred to as a value.


## Slang

#### Grok

To understand something.

#### Yak Shaving

All the things you have to do so that you can do the thing that you are actually trying to do.  

Example: I want to implement this thing but before I do that I have to launch a virtual machine but for some reason the virtual machine isn't running properly on my Windows system so now I have to trouble shoot that and 4 hours later I will give up and install Ubuntu... Now I can start implementing that thing, oh but first I have to....   Yak Shaving.
