If you have done even the smallest amount of programming chances are that "Hello World!" was one of the first things you returned. The fact that "Hello World!" is so ubiquitous within the programming community speaks to an underlying ideology that is both humbling and inspiring.

The physical world is vast and our bodies are bound by strict physical limitations.  To say "Hello World!" to the entire world would be just short of impossible.  Now, step into the world of programming, arguably far more vast than our physical world (and it is growing at an accelerated pace!), and you can say "Hello World!" to the entire world with relative ease.  

By taking the first steps towards learning to program, typing something as simple as `console.log("Hello World!")`, you have entered a whole new world with a limitless frontier - and said hello to it!  It is almost like being born again.  Everything is strange and unfamiliar.  Learning to navigate the console is like learning to walk.  There are whole languages to learn,  customs and culture to be immersed in, and opportunity to forge a new identity.  

"Hello World!" is the absolute perfect thing to have your first program say because that is what you are doing - saying hello to an entire world!
